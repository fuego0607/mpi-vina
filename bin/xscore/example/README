# Here are two examples that help X-Score users get familiar with X-Score
#

trypsin: trypsin complex with noncovalently bound napap, PDB code 1PPC 

	1ppc_protein.pdb: the protein
	1ppc_ligand.mol2: the ligand (NAPAP)
	conformers.mol2: 99 decoy conformers of the ligand plus the crystal one 

This example is designed for the users to practice using X-Score to score
multiple ligand molecules against a given target protein.

e.g. xscore score.input


enoyl: enoyl reductase-NAD+-triclosan complex, PDB code 1C14 

	1c14_protein.pdb: the protein 
	1c14_ligand.mol2: the ligand (Triclosan)
	1c14_cofactor.mol2: the cofactor (NAD)

This example is designed for the users to practice the shortcut way for 
running X-Score.

e.g. xscore -score 1c14_protein.pdb 1c14_ligand.mol2
     xscore -score 1c14_protein.pdb 1c14_cofactor.mol2 1c14_ligand.mol2
