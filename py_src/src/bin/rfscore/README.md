# RF-Score-VS 1.0

RF-Score-VS is a novel Random Forest-based scoring function for Virtual Screening which predicts binding affinity.
Its descriptors are based on RF-Score developed by Pedro Ballester et. al.
Presented binary implements RF-Score-VS v2, meaning, it counts atoms of certain types within a 12A radius, divided into 2A bins.
Further information about reported performance in various scenarios and validation across datasets, see the publication in **[article submitted]**

## Usage instructions

#### Preparations
Download package appropriate for your platform, which contains the binary and sample data to test the RF-Score-VS.
To use the scoring function uncompress the archive and open a terminal in the same directory as the binary.

#### Basic parameters

* untagged parameters are treated as docked ligands;
user can supply multiple molecular files **[required]**
* `-i` input file format; if not present then based on extension _[optional]_
* `--receptor` a protein file; format based on extension **[required]**
* `-O` output file; if `-o` is not present file format is based on extension _[optional]_
* `-o` output file format; if `-O` is not present then molecules are printed to standard output _[optional]_


#### Rescoring
RF-Score-VS predicitons are in -pK units, which means the higher the score the better.
To select best binder sort in descending order.

To rescore docked conformations simply run (on Windows omit the leading `./`):

`./rf-score-vs --receptor protein.pdb ligands.sdf -O ligands_rescored.sdf`

Producing CSV files, the RF-Score-VS score is appended to "RFScoreVS_v2" column (additional `--field` parameter to limit output columns):

`./rf-score-vs --receptor protein.pdb ligands.sdf -o csv --field "name" --field "RFScoreVS_v2"`

Running test data included with bundle:

`./rf-score-vs --receptor test/receptor_rdkit.pdb test/actives_docked.sdf -ocsv`

To get the list of all available parameters:

`./rf-score-vs --help`

**NOTE:** There is an expected overhead at the beginning of execution of RF-Score-VS binary due to setting up of temporary Python environment.
